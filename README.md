## Project Management
We will use a **Kanban system** to track the progress of the project, dividing tasks into three categories:
- **To Do:** Tasks that are planned but not yet started.
- **Doing:** Tasks that are currently in progress.
- **Done:** Completed tasks.

## Progress
- We have completed the **background story** of the game.
- Next steps include **researching the necessary skills and code implementation** for the game. These tasks will be divided equally among group members.

## Task Allocation
Each team member will be responsible for researching and implementing specific tasks. We will split the details and divide the work fairly, ensuring equal contributions from all members.

## Conclusion
This text adventure game project aims to create an engaging and immersive experience where players can explore a locked castle, make decisions, and face challenges, all while keeping track of their progress and inventory. We are excited to work on this project and deliver a fun, interactive game.
